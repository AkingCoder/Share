            There is not a single day when I don’t think about you, and I don’t miss you. I just want to go back in time and cherish all those memories that I have with you. Because, if not with you, I would love to live with your memories.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun rises and sets every day, but my world has stopped. It will move only when you come back to me again.
        </p>
        <p>
            They say the heart heals with time, but mine has refused to heal. There is no one who will ever be able to replace you in my heart. I hope this message will enable you to reconsider our life together. Come back, sweetheart.

        <p>
            I wish I could hold you tight again in my arms. I wish I could feel the warmth of your heart now. I wish I could change the time to make it happen again. Missing you too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            When someone loves you, you’ll know. When true love leaves you, you’ll know. I have the rare unfortunate privilege to experience both, all with you. Your heart is such a pure one; it’s unarguable to me. I cherish you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want you back. I have prayed to God. I have cried about my mistakes. I am not going to hide it anymore; without you, I am gone. When you left, half of me left. If you don’t come back, then it’s over for me. Give me one more chance.
